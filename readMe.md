# Lambda Functions and List Comprehensions Instructions

This project demonstrates how to use lambda functions and list comprehensions in Python.

---

## Lambda Functions

- Write a lambda function to calculate the square of a number.
- Use a lambda function to sort a list of tuples based on the second element.
- Write a lambda function to filter out even numbers from a list.
- Use a lambda function to map Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius for a list.
- Write a lambda function to sort a list of strings based on their lengths.

## List Comprehensions

- Generate a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 using list comprehension.
- Create a list of even numbers from 1 to 20 using list comprehension.
- Generate a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number and its square, for numbers from 1 to 10.
- Create a list of the first 10 multiples of 3 using list comprehension.
- Generate a list of strings where each string is the reverse of a word in another list.
